The "Software for the Analysis of Puebla Air Pollution" project analyzed air quality using historical data (2020-2024) and time series models in RStudio to identify trends and forecast pollutants. An interactive Shiny web app was developed with dynamic graphs, heat maps, and 24-hour predictions to support environmental strategies.
